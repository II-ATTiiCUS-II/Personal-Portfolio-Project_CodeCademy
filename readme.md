Codecademy project called my personal portfolio project.

Forgive me-- some of the code is messy and probably not needed because I'm still learning the do's and the do not's of coding.

For the entirety of this project I used VSCode.

I used the command line to make directories and create files to use in VSCode.

For this project I used HTML5 for the structure of the webpage, CSS3 for the styling of it all, and finally JavaScript to add a few functions and interactivity to the page.

I finally used Git bash to push my work onto GitHub.
